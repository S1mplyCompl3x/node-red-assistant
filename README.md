# node-red-assistant
A Siri like assistant built with Node-Red

### Installation
Just clone the repo, place Assistant.json inside, ~/.node-red/lib/flows/ and from inside node-red press import and select it.

## IMPORTANT
This project was made using IBM CLOUD and a few other API's so so there are some API information that need to be filled in for some nodes. The nodes that require info have **"-FIX"** at the end of their names.

Enjoy!
